GME Tracker is  basically a tracker which tracks the data of GME stock and display it with the help of Graph.
I would like to take Jacklyn Biggin for helping me creating this project in a short span.

Websites which help me to collect data and design are as follows: -

1) www.alphavantage.co (Website from where Api was collected)
2) flatuicolors.com
3) www.hexcolortool.com
4) Chartjs.org
